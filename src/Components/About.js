            <p>
              Feeling the need for a change, I decided to get out of my comfort
              zone and try something I always wanted to but was afraid of doing:
              coding! From basic YouTube tutorials to an online bootcamp and all
              the way to General Assembly in London. It has been quite an
              intense twelve-week journey and it feels like just a first step in
              a much more exciting life adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a recent graduate of General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering
              Immersive Course, I can't wait to apply my new skills and
              knowledge across web development and the latest programming
              practices. This is an exciting and bold new venture for me, and I
              am determined to make a success of it.
